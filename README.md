## About pzprxs

pzprxs is a fork of [robx/pzprjs](puzz.link), which is itself a fork of [sabo2/pzprjs]. See [the original README](https://github.com/robx/pzprjs/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

This fork contains serverless functions to generate Open Graph metadata (for link previews on Twitter, Discord etc.) and for generating thumbnail images.

This fork currently has all old puzzle types disabled, to avoid having 3 puzzle sites with the same types on it. All puzzle types are still compiled and tested. When you run this fork locally without using Vercel, all puzzle types will still be enabled.

This project accepts issues or merge requests for bugs, features, and new puzzle types.
